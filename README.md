Thirty Bees Docker compose
==========================

Start playing, selling or developing with Thirty Bees in a breeze!

Right now it includes
 - php-fpm 7
 - nginx
 - mariadb
 - memcached

I am looking for some feedback from Thirty Bees developers/users to improve and offer more options (different php versions, apache server, xdebug, opcache...). If you have some feature request or detect a bug, just open an [issue](https://github.com/DevNIX/thirtybees-docker-compose/issues/new)
